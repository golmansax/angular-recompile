Recompile library for AngularJS
===

Include <code>dist/recompile.js</code> to start using.

To play with code
---
* You need to install the packages needed by the unit tests: <code>bower update</code> and <code>sudo npm install</code>
* <code>grunt</code> builds the dist and runs the unit tests
* If you add a directive, make sure to add a spec to <code>test/</code>

TODO
* make public
* make it Bower-able
* add necessary documentation
